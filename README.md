# REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ASSIGNMENT 2

Hi all, I've added the two notebook files to the directory 'src'.
We can put all our code files in there.

We could make another folder for the report/presentation, but also keep them in this repository so we can all make changes and collaborate.

### Shell commands
Here are some useful commands for navigating when using a bash terminal (e.g. git bash)

- pwd
Shows which directory you are in
- cd <directory name>
moves to the directory
- ls
Lists the files in the directory you are currently in 

### Git commands
These are the basic git commands that will be most useful.
There are many more!

- git pull
Retrieves the latest code from github

- git add .
stages your changes for commiting

- git commit -m "some message"
makes a commit - a record of the state of the code with a message

- git push
pushes your commits to github
